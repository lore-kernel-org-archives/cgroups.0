Add docs for how to use hugetlb_cgroup reservations, and their behavior.

Changes in v6:
- Updated docs to reflect the new design based on a new counter that
tracks both reservations and faults.

 HugeTLB Controller

+1. Reservation limits
+
+The HugeTLB controller allows to limit the HugeTLB reservations per control
+group and enforces the controller limit at reservation time and at the fault of
+hugetlb memory for which no reservation exists. Reservation limits
+are superior to Page fault limits (see section 2), since Reservation limits are
+enforced at reservation time (on mmap or shget), and never causes the
+application to get SIGBUS signal if the memory was reserved before hand. For
+MAP_NORESERVE allocations, the reservation limit behaves the same as the fault
+limit, enforcing memory usage at fault time and causing the application to
+receive a SIGBUS if it's crossing its limit.
+
+2. Page fault limits
+
+The HugeTLB controller allows to limit the HugeTLB usage (page fault) per
+control group and enforces the controller limit during page fault. Since HugeTLB
+doesn't support page reclaim, enforcing the limit at page fault time implies
+that, the application will get SIGBUS signal if it tries to access HugeTLB
+pages beyond its limit. This requires the application to know beforehand how
+much HugeTLB pages it would require for its use.
+
+
+3. Caveats with shared memory
+
+For shared hugetlb memory, both hugetlb reservation and page faults are charged
+to the first task that causes the memory to be reserved or faulted, and all
+subsequent uses of this reserved or faulted memory is done without charging.
+
+Shared hugetlb memory is only uncharged when it is unreserved or deallocated.
+This is usually when the hugetlbfs file is deleted, and not when the task that
+caused the reservation or fault has exited.
