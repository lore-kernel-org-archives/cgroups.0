+  cgroup.freeze
+	A read-write single value file which exists on non-root cgroups.
+	Allowed values are "0" and "1". The default is "0".
+
+	Writing "1" to the file causes freezing of the cgroup and all
+	descendant cgroups. This means that all belonging processes will
+	be stopped and will not run until the cgroup will be explicitly
+	unfrozen. Freezing of the cgroup may take some time; when this action
+	is completed, the "frozen" value in the cgroup.events control file
+	will be updated to "1" and the corresponding notification will be
+	issued.
+
+	A cgroup can be frozen either by its own settings, or by settings
+	of any ancestor cgroups. If any of ancestor cgroups is frozen, the
+	cgroup will remain frozen.
+
+	Processes in the frozen cgroup can be killed by a fatal signal.
+	They also can enter and leave a frozen cgroup: either by an explicit
+	move by a user, or if freezing of the cgroup races with fork().
+	If a process is moved to a frozen cgroup, it stops. If a process is
+	moved out of a frozen cgroup, it becomes running.
+
+	Frozen status of a cgroup doesn't affect any cgroup tree operations:
+	it's possible to delete a frozen (and empty) cgroup, as well as
+	create new sub-cgroups.
