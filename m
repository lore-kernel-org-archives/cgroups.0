OK, it starts making sense now. The message came from
pagefault_out_of_memory which doesn't have gfp nor the required node
information any longer. This suggests that VM_FAULT_OOM has been
returned by the fault handler. So this hasn't been triggered by the page
fault allocator.
I am wondering whether this could be caused by the patch but the effect
of that one should be limitted to the write (unlike the later version
for -mm tree which hooks into the shmem as well).

Will have to think about it some more.
