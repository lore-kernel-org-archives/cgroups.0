From: Glauber Costa <glommer@openvz.org>

When a memcg is destroyed, it won't be imediately released until all
objects are gone. This means that if a memcg is restarted with the very
same workload - a very common case, the objects already cached won't be
billed to the new memcg. This is mostly undesirable since a container
can exploit this by restarting itself every time it reaches its limit,
and then coming up again with a fresh new limit.

Since now we have targeted reclaim, I sustain that we should assume that
a memcg that is destroyed should be flushed away. It makes perfect sense
if we assume that a memcg that goes away most likely indicates an
isolated workload that is terminated.
