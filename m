Hugetlb memory is out of memcg scope deliberately. This is not a
reclaimable memory and something that can easily get out of control. The
memory is preallocated and overcommit is strictly controlled as well. We
have a dedicated hugetlb cgroup controller to offer a better control of
the preallocated pool distribution.

Anyway this just shows that there are more subtle cases where a page
with no memcg can hit some common paths so the patch is clearly not
ready.

I should have realized that when giving my ack but same as you I got
misled by the existing comment.
